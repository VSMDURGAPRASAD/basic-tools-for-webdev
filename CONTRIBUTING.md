# Contributing

Welcome - by visiting this page, you've taken the first step toward becoming a contributor!

## Limited Focus

The guides listed here cover only setting up a Windows machine for software development.

If the contribution you are suggesting is for Mac users or for any other subject, it likely belongs on a different list.  You are encouraged to update the listed guides and be familiar with their contents; duplicate or overlapping guides could confuse the readers. For more awesome places to contribute, see [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).

## Not all Files and Folders should be Shared

If you have custom files from your environment, please add them to [.gitignore] and commit an updated version along with your contribution.
